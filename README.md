# Overview of the ECE 3710 projects: 
This repository contains a variety of projects that focuses on digital systems design. The first project is a finite state machine (FSM) for vehicle turn signals. It controls the left and right turn signals and hazard lights based on the input switches, ensuring correct blinking patterns for each signal. The second project involves designing a VGA controller to display output on a monitor. It includes generating the necessary synchronization signals and rendering simple graphics or text. Both projects is written in Verilog and has been implemented in the Cyclone V Altaria FPGA.
