#Finite State Machine for Turn Signal
This project involves designing a finite state machine (FSM) to control vehicle turn signals. The FSM manages four states: Off, Left Signal On, Right Signal On, and Hazard (both signals on). The system responds to inputs from the left signal switch,
right signal switch, and hazard switch to activate the appropriate signal lights. Additionally, the project includes a clock divider to manage timing, a stop light module for integrating traffic signal behavior, and a testbench (tb_stopLight) for simulation
and verification of the stop light functionality.
