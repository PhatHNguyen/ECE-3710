# Overview of the VGA

The VGA displays colors onto the monitor. In addition, it has the option to display the Thunderbird Signal onto the the monitor. 

# Files that are included 

THe folllowing files that will be included in my submission are:
1. README.md
2. VGA_Toplevel.v
3. VGATimer.v
4. bitGen1.v
5. bitGen2.v
6. tb_VGAControl.v

# Results

When running the simulation, I have tested the VGATimer to see if it will refresh the "screen" once it has finished. Fortunately, it produced the correct
result. From there, I tested it on the FPGA by displaying the colors onto the screen. All colors were able to display when using the switches. From there, I implemented
the BitGen2 with ThunderBirdSignal. With that, I tested on the FPGA and got 5 out of the LEDS to light up. This is becuase I have placed the 6th LED(third left signal) out of the
display area, causing it to not display. To fix this I shifted all of the LEDS to the right by 50 in order to get the 6th LED to be in the display area. As a resutl, I got the 
VGA module to display the ThunderBirdSignal on to the screen. 


# Problems encoountered

The only problem that I have encounter was the 6th LED (third left signal ) not displaying on the screen. This is because the 6th LED section was not in the active area. To
fix, i shifted the LEDS sections of the active area to the right by 50 pixels. This allow it to the 6th LED to be in active display area. As a result, my VGA module is able 
to produce the ThunderBirdSignal onto the screen.
